    "**At the end of this week, you should be able to:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain how padding works to perserve image dimensions during convolution\n",
    "- Explain different kinds of padding like constant, reflect, replicate, etc.\n",
    "- Explain how 2d convolutions are performed on images\n",
    "  - Be able to manually run or implement an algorithm that, given a kernel and an image or array, convolves the image with the kernel\n",
    "- Have a rough understand of the differences between cross correlation and convolution.\n",
    "- Know how you can construct different kind of kernels for specific purposes like blurring, edge enhancement, sharpening, etc.\n",

    "If we have our input image $f_{in}$ (which we assume is of size $N \\times N$ pixels) and a kernel K, the convolution is defined by:\n",

Practically, you don't need to worry about this whole \"flipping of the kernel\", it will rarely be relevant in machine learning, and mostly exists in pure signal processing. \n",

    "<!-- However, if you're curious, the below video shows the simple difference between cross correlation and convolution in a 1D case.

This is for example the case in [pytorch's \"Conv2d\"](https://docs.pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.Conv2d.html). The point is, don't worry too much about it when doing machine learning, just know the difference.\n",

    "\n",
    "We do not show it explicitly, but assume we have some random variable $X$, whose true probability distribution $p$ we attempt to approximate with some other probability distribution $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why is this useful? Two reasons mainly:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. It gives us a very intuitive way of evaluating the performance of models that output probability distributions for classification, like neural networks.\n",
    "2. It has some nice mathematical properties that directly ties it to multinomial logistic regression. (Which also gives it the cursed name of **\"Negative Binomial Log-Likelihood\"** (please don't ever call it that, it is the **Cross-Entropy**))\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of its properties (especially, its relation to the \"[Kullback-Liebler (KL) Divergence](https://johfischer.com/2021/12/31/intuitive-explanation-of-the-kullback-leibler-divergence/)\"), the cross-entropy can be seen as measuring the \"total cost\" (in bits of information) of representing $p$ (the correct probability distribution) with $q$ (the approximate probability distribution)... optimal for modelling in ML. Why the **total** cost? Because the cross-entropy (unlike the KL-divergence) incorporates the intrinsic entropy of the variable in question. \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the cross-entropy is actually \"just\" the sum of the KL divergence (how different our approximating distribution is from the true distribution), and the entropy (how uncertain the true distribution is). Therefore, when approximating a given distribution with some other distribution, the cross-entropy denotes how much uncertainty we are left with, or how much information we have to \"pay\" (usually paid in guesses) to get correct clasifications."
